* java implementation of GB 32960 protocol

* Project background:
The state stipulates that new energy vehicles need to upload vehicle data to the national regulatory platform in real time after sale, and the uploaded vehicle data needs to meet the requirements of the gb-32960 agreement. However, the management and control platform of many automobile enterprises and the intelligent terminal (tbox) on the vehicle body are customized communication protocols. In order to upload vehicle data to the national supervision platform, the mapping and conversion of tbox protocol data and gb32960 protocol data are required. In order to facilitate protocol conversion, this universal gb32960 protocol implementation is implemented.
